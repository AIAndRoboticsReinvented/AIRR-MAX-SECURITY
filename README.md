# AIRR-MAX-SECURITY 
This module is to act as security mechinism for applications. It will interface with existing security systems such as Active Directory to simplify management.

# Technology
Default back end database for this project is MS SQL Server 2016, however we would also like to support MYSQL, XML and JSON.

Web Services will access the database to validate security, first run will be using ASP.NET but also like a PHP version.

A valid security authorization will provide a token that is bound to the user and the computer that the user is on. 

Any time a user attempts to perform an action on a system a check may be performed by passing the token and requested action. If valid, an authorization will be returned to the caller.
